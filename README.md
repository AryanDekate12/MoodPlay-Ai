# 🎮 MoodPlay AI  
### AI Mood-Based Game Recommendation System

MoodPlay AI is an AI-powered web application that recommends games based on a user's **mood and preferred device (Mobile or Laptop)**.

The system detects the user's mood from text input using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and suggests games using **real-time game data APIs**.

The project is built with **Python, Machine Learning, NLP, and Streamlit** to create an interactive recommendation system.

# 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters their mood in text form.
2. NLP analyzes the text to detect the mood.
3. The machine learning model predicts a suitable game genre.
4. The system fetches real-time games from the API.
5. The application recommends games based on:
   - Mood
   - Device type
   - Game popularity
   - Rating and availability
